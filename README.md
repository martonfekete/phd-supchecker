## Requirements for Proof of Concept

No database or API's will be set up for the PoC, data will be using browser storage with some defaults.

### Main page
Explain the concept.
Mention already participating institutions?

Three main sections:
- volunteer
- request feedback
- unsubscribe

### Volunteer!
Create a simple, mobile-first form to allow volunteering to provide feedback later.

1. Data fields:
   - name
   - supervisor name (autosuggest for already submitted names)
   - institution (with autosuggest for already submitted)
   - official email address
   - secondary email address (serves as contact when the feedback is requested)

Once form is submitted, the supervisor and institution will be searchable in the finder (see below). 

### Feedback finder 
Create a simple form to search the volunteers based on supervisor or institution.
On a hit, show button to request feedback.

When feedback is requested, the volunteers are alerted.

### Unsubscribe
Create a simple form to allow volunteers to be removed from the database.
